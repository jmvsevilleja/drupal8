<h3 style="color: #ffffff !important;">At Intellichoice we LOVE Owner Builder Loans and have successfully completed hundreds of these loan types over 15 years</h3>
Fixed home loans allow you to lock-in a constant interest rate for your loan principal in a given period. Unlike variable loans that adjust parallel to the market, fixed loans allow you to enjoy a lower interest rate in the event that rates go up in a year or so. Looking to get a fixed rate for your home loan? Talk to an Intellichoice mortgage broker today.
