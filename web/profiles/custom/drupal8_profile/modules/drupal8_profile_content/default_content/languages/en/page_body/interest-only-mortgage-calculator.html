Interest only mortgage is interest-only payments within a specified period of time which is usually five years for a 30-year loan. After the interest-only period, the loan is amortized for the remainder of the term. This means that your monthly repayment is going to be higher as you are going to start paying for the principal of the loan too. If you would want to enjoy light payments on your loan for the first few months or years of your finance, this is the financial calculator that you need to be able to do so.

The computation for the interest-only payment is quite simple. Get the unpaid loan balance then multiply it by the interest rate. The figure you get is the annual interest, divide this amount by 12 months. What you get are your monthly interest repayments.
