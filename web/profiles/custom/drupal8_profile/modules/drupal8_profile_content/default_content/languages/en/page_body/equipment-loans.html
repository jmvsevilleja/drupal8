What is equipment loan anyway and how to apply for this? Most equipment loans requires collateral. Lending companies use the equipment to protect or secure the loan. It is a kind of small business loan designed for people with bad credit records. Intellichoice is the number one choice here in Australia as we provide equipment loan through connecting borrowers to the right lending companies or banks that specifically cater their needs. We believe that everyone has the right to be given another chance as bad credit history does not really limit someone ‘s capacity to pay.
