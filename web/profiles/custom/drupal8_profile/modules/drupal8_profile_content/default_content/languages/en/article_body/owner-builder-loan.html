<em>What is the most common question clients ask?</em>
<blockquote>They want to know how they’re going to go about getting their money from the lender. Is it going to be a progress draw situation or is the lender going to set the line up like a quazy line of credit? And they just need to understand that process of how will I actually pay for the items and the labor exception that they need to put into their construction.</blockquote>
<em>And what is their most common concern?</em>
<blockquote>Their most common concern is that they’re not going to have the funds available when they need them to spend. So we need to be able to guide them through that process. We need to actually demonstrate to them that we can create a working buffer for them so that they’ve got working capital. We need to just align their fears that will look after their progress drawl so that they’re not going to have huge time delays between we’re completing getting paid for and being able to convince the next stage.</blockquote>
