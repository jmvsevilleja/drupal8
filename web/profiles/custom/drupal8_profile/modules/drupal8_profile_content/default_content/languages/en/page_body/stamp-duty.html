<span style="font-weight: 400;">An important cost that you must think about when purchasing a home is stamp duty. Getting a new home could be the biggest purchase that many individuals can make. The totals concerned can imply that the amount of stamp duty could be an issue. </span>
<h3>What is Stamp Duty?</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stamp duty is a tax imposed by the state on several forms of transactions. These transactions include transfers and contracts for a real estate sale (known as transfer duty), policies of insurance, documented gifts, home loans, goods rental, and motor vehicle licenses.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of stamp duty a person pays varies with respect to the property value for purchase, and it is determined by the government of the State from which you are buying it. Establishing the total you need to pay for can be baffling because every state follows an approach that is different from the other. Above that, there are exemptions for first-time home buyers, different rates to follow when purchasing a land, and sometimes there's a separate cost for mortgage duty to pay. </span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general rule in computing stamp duty is that the cheaper the property, the lesser the tax levied. Most states follow a category system based on value. The stamp duty calculator provided on this site can help you make an estimation of the closest amount to pay on your home loan. </span></h3>
