Organizations usually select to lease assets instead of making a purchase, this is specifically true for assets used for the long term. The choice to lease is primarily based on specific factors such as need, better economic conditions, keep the asset detail from the balance sheet, or insufficient funds to make a purchase. The types of accounting methods for leases are Finance Lease or <a href="https://www.intellichoice.com.au/business-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leasing Finance</a> and Operating Lease. Both leases are being used for distinct reasons and lead to different treatment in the accounting process.

<h3>Which is a better route for a business, Finance Lease or Operating Lease?</h3>
A better route depends on the business’ specific circumstance. While finance lease and an operating lease has their own pros and cons, here are the most obvious that you can consider in your decision.

Operating Lease offers a reduced the administrative responsibilities of the lessee and allows them to return the equipment at the end of lease term while paying a fixed monthly payment as agreed upon in the contract. This route is ideal for businesses that are running a few pieces of equipment as a result of administration savings.

Finance Lease will have to assume more administrative responsibilities. Also, the lessee will have to face additional resale risks when comes a time that the business decides to sell the property in the future. The positive aspect of the finance lease is that the lessee can assume ownership of the property depending on the success of the ‘offer to buy’.
