<h2 class="infinite-single-article-title">Why do People Owner Builder</h2>
It’s a question we get asked a lot and the best way I can answer it is to put it in the words of a customer who completed their home last week after a nine month construction phase.

“Ever since I met my wife, we have spoken about our dream house. For years, we have been planning what it would be like. How many bedrooms, what kind of backyard it would have. But cost just keep going up and we were starting to think we could By going down the owner builder route, we were able to get more for our money and get the home we wanted.”

Of course <a href="https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/saving-budgeting/ways-to-save-money">saving money</a> isn’t the only reason people choose to owner build. Many of our clients are tradies or project managers who have many years experience within the industry.

For them, the advantage of being an owner builder is that they get to be in control and to make sure they are getting exactly what they want. They figure they are the ones who will be living in the house and they want to know it is being done right.

The reasons our clients choose to <strong>Owner Build</strong> are as varied as our clients themselves. It’s not always easy and there are certainly pitfalls along the way.
