<strong>Are you a Developer?</strong>

You can usually borrow the smaller of 80% of the project cost or 70% of the value on completion.

Banks do not usually approve low doc loans for developers because they have an unpredictable income and there are often long delays between completing their projects are receiving payment.

For this reason, there are special loans for developers. These loans have an established exit date and capitalised interest and this is to avert the need for repayments.

<strong>Can you get loan approval?</strong>

The majority of banks will only offer you a loan for your project if you are building with a licensed builder insured with Home Warranty Insurance (HWI) or equivalent.
