<h3>Introductory or Honeymoon Rate Home Loans</h3>

<p>Introductory or honeymoon rate home loans offer you a discount off the standard variable interest rate at the beginning of your home loan. The discount can be up to one percent off the standard variable rate and is usually for the first 6-12 months of the home loan. After this period has expired, the interest rate will revert to the mortgage lender’s standard variable interest rate.&nbsp;<strong>Advantages of an introductory home loan</strong></p>

	<li>During the honeymoon period, the interest rate cannot go higher, but it may go lower if the mortgage lender’s standard variable interest rate falls</li>
	<li>Repayments made at introductory rates can reduce the principal quickly, as there is less interest charged during the specified period.</li>
	<li>An offset facility can usually be used in conjunction with an introductory home loan</li>
