<h3>How do you calculate income tax?</h3>
Understanding how much you earn helps you understand how much tax you owe. Employed individuals are deducted with tax by their employers and are paid to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) on your behalf.

Entrepreneurs and business owners calculate their income tax, or through an accountant and submit it individually to the ATO, together with the tax payment.

The amount of tax you pay for depends on the marginal tax rates of the fiscal year, also known as tax brackets.
<h3>What are the tax brackets for 2018?</h3>
Each year, tax brackets are released in Australia to determine how much tax you are liable to the government.
