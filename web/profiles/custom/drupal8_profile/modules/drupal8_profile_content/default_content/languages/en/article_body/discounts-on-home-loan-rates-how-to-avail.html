<h3>Make That Call</h3>
The way lenders and banks decide on how much interest rate they apply on your loan depends on several factors. Your financial situation such as your earnings, how much you will borrow and at times, your occupation determines the discounted rate you’ll receive on your mortgage. The more money you earn, the stronger investment for the lender.

Even if the advertised interest rate of the major banks can vary and you might get entitled to a discount if you make that call. You might want to explore the attractive incentives and package deals some of these banks offers. Make that call and coordinate with your bank or lender or let your mortgage specialist secure the best discount possible for your home loan.

For example, a home loan of anywhere above $150,000 can come with an annual fee-free credit card, a $600 loan approved with fees waived, an offset account and monthly service fees waived. You just need to coordinate with your bank or lender to be able to avail the best possible deals available for you.

It pays to be pushy and know what you deserve. Some banks just rely on lazy customers that are not coordinating with them in terms of possible discounts. Get the phone and do not be afraid to ask for a discount.
<h3>Do Your Research</h3>
Not knowing your numbers can cost you a lot- literally. For example, for an LVR of less than 80% with a home worth $500,000 and a loan less than $400,000, you can take control of your home loan interest rate. You can easily take control and switch lenders without worrying about excess lender’s mortgage insurance. This can be quite costly for a mortgage with an LVR higher than 80%. Reconsider taking that switch for a better deal on your mortgage or talk with your bank to know your options.
