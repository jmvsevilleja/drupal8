Luckily, there are non-conforming lenders and financial institutions that provides owner builder home loans for owner builders that can provide security for a mortgage. Qualifying can sometimes be difficult but is not impossible. Working hand in hand with experienced owner builder home loan specialists can make a huge difference in your application.

<h2>Getting Approved for Owner Builder Construction Loans</h2>
For licensed builders, the maximum amount of mortgage that can be approved when applying is 95% of the total project cost. This includes the cost of the land plus the cost included in the construction of the home. However, bot all lenders can provide 95% LVR. The allowable amount to be borrowed varies from one borrower to another, depending on their financial circumstance.

If you are not a registered builder, but an Owner Builder you will most likely get 60% of the projects to build cost-and that's if you can even find a bank who provides Owner Builder Loans. At Intellichoice, we can do as much as 75% loan to value ratio (LVR) for licensed or permitted Owner builders.

You will need to show some experience in project managing a build or have someone with a background in the construction industry providing support.

<h2>Why Have Banks Stopped Entertaining Owner Builder Loans?</h2>
Banks have ceased receiving applications for Owner Builder Construction Loans for quite some time due to the risk involved in the process. There are instances during the construction wherein people involved in the project change plans, go over budget or for some, they were unable to complete the construction right after a progress payment. This became too much to handle for banks, thus declining most owner build loan applications.

Licensed builders who have more experience in handling and delivering a construction project can be considered as lower-risk compared to owner builders. Intellichoice caters such clients as well. We have Low Doc Construction Loans available for those who fall under this circumstance.

You can also work with a licensed builder to proceed with your owner build. However, don't start with your build project without sitting down with your contractor and your mortgage broker. Fill in the gaps of details you would want to address on your project prior to proceeding with the loan application, much more with the actual construction. Be careful when dealing with contractors.
