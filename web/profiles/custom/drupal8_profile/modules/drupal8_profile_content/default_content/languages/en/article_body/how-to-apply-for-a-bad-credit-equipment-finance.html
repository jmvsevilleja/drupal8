<h3>What is a Bad Credit Equipment Finance?</h3>
Let's first define what <a href="https://www.intellichoice.com.au/asset-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equipment finance</a> is. These are small business loans that provide financing for your choice of equipment to help grow your business. Most equipment loans are collateralized which means the lending company will use the equipment to secure the loan. Bad credit equipment loans are also equipment loans, however, they are designed especially for people with bad credit.

While banks may not offer bad credit loans, there are specialized lending companies in Australia that provide this type of loan. So, your very first step is to scout for lending companies in Australia that look past your credit history but into your capacity to pay. Intellichoice Finance can help you connect with the right banks and lending companies that can accommodate your financing needs.
<h3>How to Apply for Bad Credit Equipment Finance?</h3>
An application for a bad credit equipment finance follows the same process as traditional loans. You will need to submit a fully accomplished application form and other supporting documents to confirm your financial standing. Loan companies will evaluate your application after which decide whether or not to approve your loan.
<h4>What documents should be submitted?</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Fully accomplished application form</li>
 	<li>Proof of identification</li>
 	<li>Registered ABN</li>
 	<li>Business bank transaction statements</li>
 	<li>Details of the business assets and liabilities</li>
 	<li>Credit card statements</li>
 	<li>Profit and loss statements</li>
 	<li>BAS statements</li>
</ul>
<h4>Look for specialized lending companies who offer bad credit business loans.</h4>
As mentioned earlier in this post, getting financing from a bank when you have a bad credit is not an option. Banks are very strict when it comes to loan applications. In fact, banks require at least a credit score of 700. Your best option is to look at lending companies who specialize in providing loans to individuals or businesses with poor or bad credit.
<h4>Obtain a copy of your credit score.</h4>
You will need to <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/individuals/faqs-for-individuals/credit-reporting/accessing-your-credit-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get a copy of your credit file</a> to confirm your credit score. Your credit history can verify your financial history and can provide you with information on ways on how to improve it. Work on improving your credit before applying for a loan. This will help lenders see your effort beyond the numbers. You may also want to consider working with a credit repair service to help you increase your credit standing.
<h4>Provide a collateral to secure the loan</h4>
One of the most effective ways you can balance a bad credit is by means of having some type of security to provide loan companies. With bad credit equipment finance, you don't have to use your house or your car to post as collateral. You can use the same equipment you’re looking to purchase to secure the loan. And because there’s collateral securing the loan, lending companies will look beyond a bad credit score.
<h4>Bottom Line</h4>
Bad Credit Equipment Loans can help many individuals hoping to grow their business and create a better income for the family. While the application can be tricky, you have a better chance of approval if you choose a lending company who have tailored loans specifically for bad credit. And since all equipment loans are collateralized loans, you have a higher chance of approval. If still in doubt, you can contact a loan specialist to help match you with the right lender for your needs.
