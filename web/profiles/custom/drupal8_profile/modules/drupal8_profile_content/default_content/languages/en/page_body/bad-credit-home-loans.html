There are some differences between this type of loan compared to a traditional <a href="/personal-loans">home loan</a>. You may be required to provide a bigger deposit. This is because if you have a bad credit it’s difficult to get mortgage insurance. Normally when borrowing more than eighty (80%) of your property value, you are required to obtain Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI). At Intellichoice, we provide you with all the information you need to acquire a bad credit loan and we walk you through the process in a simple, easy to understand, way.
