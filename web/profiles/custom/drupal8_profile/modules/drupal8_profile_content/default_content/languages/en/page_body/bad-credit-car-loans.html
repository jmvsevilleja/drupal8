<strong>What is a bad credit rating car loan?</strong>

A bad credit car loan is for people that cannot get pre approved for a car loan through traditional lending sources. If you've had a low credit score or you have a low income, you may have encountered rejection from traditional lenders and methods.

<strong>Who should apply for a bad credit car loan?</strong>

If you've previously had a bad credit raing or your suffered bankruptcy then a bad credit car loan is going to suit you.

You must be discharged from bankruptcy before you can get approved. A bad credit car loan will help you get a second chance at finance to prove yourself and earn a <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/score-basics/what-is-a-good-credit-score/">good credit rating</a> again.

<strong>What Loan term can I have?</strong>

Depending on how severe the bad credit was the loan term can range from 2 to 7 years. Only minor defaults will qualify for a 7 year term so it’s more than likely it will only be a term from 2 to 5 years. The length of term will also depend on how much your income will service the loan.

<strong>How do I qualify for a bad credit car loan?</strong>

<strong>In order to qualify you need to:</strong>

1. Currently reside in Australia.

2. Have residency or a visa.

3. Able to obtain car insurance.

Most lenders require a working phone number and proof of residence such as a utility or credit card statement.
