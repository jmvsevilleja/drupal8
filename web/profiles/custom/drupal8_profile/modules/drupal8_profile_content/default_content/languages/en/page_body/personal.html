A personal loan is a secured or unsecured line of credit. You can use the money for a range of purposes, for example buying a car consolidating a debt, paying for a wedding, hospital bills and so forth. Personal loans are personal because the funds can use at your discretion. Personal loans are an agreement between two parties you and the lender, for you to have a specific amount of money and pay it back over time or the time frame of your payment is determined by the specific terms of your loan. The interest rate on your loan is determined by your credit score.

Whether you need to renovate your home, plan for a holiday or wedding or need to consolidate your debts, a mortgage broker from Intellichoice can help you with a personal loan to make it happen.

A personal loan is essentially a lump sum of money that you borrow from a mortgage lender. Personal loans are generally meant for personal use only. That is, the money must be wholly or predominately for personal or domestic use. Personal loans cannot be taken out for business use, such as starting a business, stock for a business or to purchase a car for the business. If you do require a loan for your business or to purchase inventory, we have alternative business finance solutions to suit your needs.

There are many reasons why individuals apply for a loan. They may be looking for the home they’ve been dreaming for, a car or simply to go on a holiday. At times we need something in a hurry and simply don’t have the budget to fund it straight away.

Sourcing the finance for what you want doesn’t have to be a burdensome thing. With Intellichoice, we can help advise and source the right options for you, through our specialist team of experts.

<strong>How does Personal Loans work?</strong>

They are fairly simple and straightforward. When you apply and receive the approval for the loan, you will receive the amount of money you requested to borrow in a lump sum. You pay back the money in installments. The timeframe of those payments is determined by the specific terms of your loan. A great rate will save you money when you repay the debt because you will be required to pay less on interest. If you have questions or need more information, don’t be afraid to ask our Loan Specialist.
