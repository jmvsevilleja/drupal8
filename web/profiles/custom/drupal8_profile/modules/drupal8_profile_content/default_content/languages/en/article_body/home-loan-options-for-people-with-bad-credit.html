<h3>How to Start Fixing Your Bad Credit?</h3>
It is advisable to first take a look at your financial standing. Begin with getting a copy of your credit file through Veda, Experian, or Dun and Bradstreet. Review your credit history and determine where the gaps are so that you can start fixing them.
<ul>
 	<li>Do you have outstanding debts or unsettled bills? Take the necessary steps to settle your outstanding debts. You can call them and see how to start making payments.</li>
 	<li>Late payments? Make sure to start making payments on time. If you believe a late payment report is an error, you can call the company and come up with amendments.</li>
 	<li>Loan or credit application rejections? If you have already been rejected, avoid making frequent loan enquiries. Instead, hold back and put up some savings.</li>

All it takes is patience and diligence from your part. Soon enough, everything will fall into place.
