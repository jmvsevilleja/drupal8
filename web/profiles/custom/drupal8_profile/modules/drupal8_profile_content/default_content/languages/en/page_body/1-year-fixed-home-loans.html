<strong>Should you fix your rate?</strong>

Many people stay with a variable rate because they think that rates are going to come down.

While, others who are worried about the effect of rising interest rates and want a more certain idea of their future payments choose to fix.

You may be uncertain what to do… But if you fix for just one year you can take advantage of discounts and low interest rates!

<strong>What you need to consider</strong>

Before fixing your interest rate you should consider whether it will be a good option for you.

There is continuing speculation that the RBA will decrease interest rates. Although, major banks don’t even know whether the RBA will cut rates and if rates are cut there is no guarantee that the major banks will follow.

Business costs are rising and a number of major lenders are raising their standard variable rates independent of the RBA.

We can help you fix a low rate, saving you on your loan and giving you more stability.

<strong>When is the right time to fix it?</strong>

It is best to fix your rate when market rates are coming down and lenders are pricing competitively.

Following the RBA and financial commentary can help you in deciding the best time to fix your loan.
