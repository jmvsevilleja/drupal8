95% Home Loan Australian lenders no longer offer no deposit <a href="https://www.intellichoice.com.au/other-home-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home loans</a> but some lenders still offer loans for 95% of the purchase price. This type of loan is often referred to as a 95% Loan to Valuation Ratio (LVR) loan.

Lenders are much stricter when it comes to accepting these loans.

You may be wondering what you need to do to secure a 95% loan. And which lender has the best 95%<a href="https://www.intellichoice.com.au/is-it-better-to-get-loan-from-the-bank-or-from-the-broker" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> loan package</a> for you.

<strong>Can You Borrow 95%?</strong>

Loans more than 80% of the purchase price are considered, by Australian lenders, to be high-risk loans. Therefore lenders insure these loans with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenders_mortgage_insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lenders Mortgage Insurance</a> (LMI).

The companies that offer the LMI have separate lending guidelines that are more conservative than the banks. These stricter guidelines make borrowing 95% much more difficult to secure than other home loans.

<strong>What Type of Borrowers are the Banks Looking For?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>You should have a good credit history with no defaults or other marks. You should also have consistently paid rent, credit cards, personal loans and other bills on time for the previous 6 months.</li>
 	<li>Steady employment in the same job for 6 to 12 months. Lenders may make exceptions to this policy.</li>
 	<li>A good income and ‘serviceability ratio’.Lenders are stricter when considering your ability to repay a 95% loan.</li>
 	<li>A decent asset position relative to your income and age.</li>
 	<li>Lenders expect you to have Genuine savings of 5% of the purchase price. You can still borrow if you don’t have savings as you may be eligible for a 95% no savings loan or a 110% guarantor home loan. Some lenders will consider the rent you have paid during the previous 12 months or even a parental gift as genuine savings.</li>
 	<li>You should have minimal debts. Applicants that have a high credit card and personal loan debt are usually not accepted. As a rule of thumb, if your unsecured debt exceeds 5% you will normally be denied a 95% loan.</li>
 	<li>A good location and/or property type. Lenders are often cautious when granting loans for small town properties, high rise apartment units in the CBD or other uncommon properties.</li>

<strong>Can you borrow over $1,000,000?</strong>

The truth is that most of lenders only offer 95% mortgages for up to $700,000 or $800,000. There are a few more relaxed lenders that allow you up to $1,000,000.

But $1,000,000 is the limit for 95% home loans. This is because there are Lenders Mortgage Insurer restrictions that stop you from borrowing more. Some lenders have exclusive agreements with their LMI insurer and will offer a 95% loan up to $1,500,000 if you are in an extremely strong financial situation.

Typically LMI can be capitalised (included in the loan amount) for loans less than $1,000,000. On the other hand for loans over $1,000,000 you cannot capitalise LMI and so you must pay the mortgage insurance with the loan amount. This means you are borrowing around 91.5% plus LMI.

<strong>Which lenders offer 95% loans?</strong>

Lenders have limited reserves to lend out. At the same time they want the most profits while minimizing risk. 95% home loans are inherently very high risk. Therefore lenders assign most of their available funds to loans that are less.

Because lenders only have a limited amount of money to lend at 95% they only lend to low risk borrowers.
