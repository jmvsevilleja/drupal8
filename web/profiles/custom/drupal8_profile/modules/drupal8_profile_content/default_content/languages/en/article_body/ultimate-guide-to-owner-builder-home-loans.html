<h3>Why Do Few Banks Offer Owner Builder Loans?</h3>
Giving out a loan to a client has a lot of risks. Bad credit loans, for example, are hard to find and only non-conforming lenders offer such chances for people with bad credit. Banks measure the risks that each client poses.

Another challenge that comes with owner-builder projects is the possibility of drastic changes along the way. The initial plan may have been revised, or the construction schedule is not being met. Some construction can go over budget or delays and other issues during the construction that directly affects the cost of the project. On worst case scenarios, some projects remain incomplete â€“ scenes most banks would rather not experience.

When entering the owner-built road to your dream home, you should weigh this possibility. Do you really need financing from a bank and would a bank see you fit as a borrower? Your experience and expertise as a licensed builder or hiring one with such credibility increases the chances of a loan approval.

<h3>Golden Rules for a Successful Owner Build Project</h3>
The challenge of an owner-built project does not only lies with the funding. The bigger part of the pie is the actual construction of the project. Even with careful planning, problems could go pop up anywhere down the construction road. Here are some Golden Rules you should live by to make your owner builder project a success.

<strong>Always have a contingency plan ready.</strong> As part of your preparation prior to applying for an owner builder home loan, you should have included at least 10%-15% of the total amount of your construction project to the total amount or value of your build. This amount serves as your back up plan in the event of a sudden increase in the prices of construction materials or any other scene that may affect the cost of your build.

<strong>Check your builder prior to application.</strong> There are ways to determine if your contractor is indeed a licensed builder or not. Working with an employee of the builder is way different from working with the actual builder. The equipment, manpower and expertise of the actual builder are incomparable to what a builder-employee can do. Always know the difference. You can <a href="https://www.intellichoice.com.au/the-construction-route-for-your-home-is-your-builder-legit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out this article</a> to determine if your builder is indeed a licensed and reliable one.

<strong>Practice patience.</strong> Most banks would not approve a loan if the project is already starting. Owner-builder loans are released in drawdowns and each stage is definite. It would not be ideal to start ahead if you would want to proceed with the financial help from a mortgage. Wait for the process to finish and get a written approval before proceeding with your project.

<strong>Have a budget set aside.</strong> A contingency amount added on the total amount of your loan is within the loan. Thus, it is essential to have cash in hand that can be used to fund your project without waiting for a drawdown to be released. Most licensed and experienced contractors can finance a construction even without relying on the drawdown stages or the incremental release of your loan from the bank. However, if you are the builder of your own project, a considerable amount of cash would be essential to stay on track of your owner-built.

A successful owner-builder loan application depends on you and the broker that you will work with to complete the application. Most banks do now do owner builder home loans anymore. However, with Intellichoice, connecting with banks and lenders that do owner builder loans is a breeze. Take the first step with Intellichoice Finance.
