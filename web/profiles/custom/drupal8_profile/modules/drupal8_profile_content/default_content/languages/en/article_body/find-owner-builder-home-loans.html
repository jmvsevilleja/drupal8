<h2>Owner Builder Loans Australia</h2>
<strong>Your home may be one of the most important purchases you will ever make.</strong>

It is a big decision and one that may have a long-term impact on your financial strategy.

The challenge for an owner builder is to demonstrate to the lender the "intrinsic" value you bring to your project.  Intellichoice has developed a unique approach to solving this dilemma.  We work collaboratively with you to demonstrate the optimal <em>end market value </em>of your property, which is the key to maximizing your borrowing for your construction project.  Through this approach, Intellichoice has a track record of obtaining lending at 80% of land value and 100% of construction costs, based on the <em>end market value.</em>

If you have already commenced your "finance" journey you will have identified there are very few financiers in Australia who provide owner builder loans.  Owner-builder lending makes up less than one percent of all loans.  If you approach one of these lenders it can be difficult to find an "expert" within the institution who can guide you through the financial aspects of your owner builder construction project.

This gap in the mortgage market is a legacy of lender caution created by owner builder projects not being completed within budget and within reasonable timeframes.  Hence a well planned and executed owner build has a huge potential to create wealth.
