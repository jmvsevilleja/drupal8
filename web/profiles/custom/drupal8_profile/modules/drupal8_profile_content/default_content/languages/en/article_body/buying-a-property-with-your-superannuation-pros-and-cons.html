<h2 class="infinite-single-article-title">Buying a Property with Your Superannuation: Pros and Cons</h2>
<a href="https://www.intellichoice.com.au/self-managed-super-fund-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superannuation</a> in Australia is money set aside by the employer throughout the working life of an employee meant for retirement. The money can only be withdrawn in very specific circumstances such as during retirement at 65 years of age.

May Australians have become used to the idea of putting aside money for their retirement. This was since the introduction of the compulsory employer superannuation contributions under the Keating Labor Government in 1992.

With this cause, several Australians have taken the step further to invest more than the required amount. Eventually, they have started to seize the opportunity of taking direct control of the funds through <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Self Managed Super Fund</a> or SMSF.

For many, the attractiveness of an SMSF is its capacity to be utilized for property purchase, the tax benefits, and control over your funds. On the other hand, it also requires a lot of planning and continuous attention to make sure it is managed effectively and that the policies are met all the time.
<h3>Pros of Property Investment Using Superannuation</h3>
A few of the considerable advantages of purchasing property through your superannuation are as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>It’s a fairly stable and low-risk investment when compared with other available choices</li>
 	<li>Can provide significant returns</li>
 	<li>It provides a means to broaden your <a href="https://www.intellichoice.com.au/investment-and-advice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investment portfolio</a></li>
 	<li>Efficiently targeted investment properties can produce extra revenue</li>
 	<li>There is more control over property investment which includes shares that are susceptible to fluctuations in the market</li>
