<h3><strong>Five useful tips for first time home buyers with bad credit</strong></h3>
<h3>1. Understand why you have a bad credit. Get a copy of your credit history.</h3>
Before you even sign that application form or talk to another lending institution, seek for a copy of your credit file. Understand why you ended up with a bad standing in the first place.

There are numerous factors that may have to lead your credit standing to bad credit. Below are a few of the factors to look at.
<ul>
 	<li>Unpaid bills</li>

 	<li>Applied for credit too often</li>
 	<li>Declared bankruptcy</li>
</ul>
You want to make sure that you know your credit history. All home loan lenders will look closely at this, so you want to discuss negative marks on your file with no qualms.

 	<li>If your spouse has a better credit standing than yours, it will greatly help your loan application.</li>

<h3>2. Settle any outstanding debts and pay off existing debts</h3>
<strong>Lenders will ask you what steps you have taken to repair your credit standing.</strong> Naturally, you will want to pay outstanding debts. Contact companies listed with late payments and see if they can remove negative report. Some companies can do that for you especially if you have built a good rapport with the company.

<strong>Payoff existing debts.</strong> Lenders will look into your current credit accounts like your credit card bills and personal loans. It is important that you don’t have any existing loans when applying for a home loan. Payoff all existing debts for a better chance of approval.

<strong>Consider a credit repair service.</strong> A credit repair specialist can help you in a number of ways. They can review your credit report and help remove negative listings in your credit history if those negative listings are not adherent to laws. This can greatly improve your credit standing.
<h3>3. Choose a lender who offers home loans despite bad credit</h3>
There are specialized lenders in Australia who offer bad credit home loans. These lenders will look into your file and understand why you ended up in bad credit. Bad credit standing is, in many cases, reflective of many factors. It could be a result of lifestyle change or unwanted circumstances such as sickness or divorce. Be honest when these lenders ask for an explanation.

They will compare your credit standing against your income. It helps to know that you have a good and stable source of income. Note that a higher income can sometimes override bad credit depending on how the lender views it.
<h3>4. Avoid applying for too many loans in a little space of time</h3>
Your credit report will include all previous inquiries for past loan applications. Take careful steps when inquiring about home loans especially when you already have a bad credit standing in your record. Too many inquiries in a little space of time can lead to raised red flags to lenders.
<h3>5. Consider Lenders with their own Lender's Mortgage Insurance (LMI) before applying</h3>
There are only two major providers for LMI in Australia - Genworth, and QBE. These major providers are very strict when it comes to evaluating loans which in many cases leads to rejected loans. Specialized lenders have their own LMI alternative so that you have better chances of getting an approval.
