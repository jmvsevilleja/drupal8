<h3>6 Things to Consider When Comparing Business Loans</h3>
Not one loan is the best business loan. It all really depends on the circumstances surrounding your situation. But you should always keep the following in mind when comparing business loans.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Can your business afford to get a loan?</strong> The most important factor in taking out a loan is to consider if your business can afford it. Consider the costs upon taking out a loan including the monthly repayments you will have to pay. Match it with your business's monthly revenue and the already existing expenses that your business will have to pay.</li>
 	<li><strong>What is the working interest rate on the loan?</strong> In order for you to understand better interest rates, you will have to know variable and fixed interest rates. These types of interest rates can have a great effect on your business if you choose one over the other. A fixed rate is not affected by fluctuating interest rates while variable rates change as the market rate changes.</li>
 	<li><strong>How can I make repayments for the loan?</strong> Lump-sum loans have fixed terms which include the loan amount and the interest spread over the life of the loan. Take into account that lenders are often way more versatile with monthly payments for business loans compared to personal loans. Verify your lender’s repayment conditions prior to applying for a loan. Note that lines of credit don’t follow a fixed repayment condition.</li>
 	<li><strong>What is a comparison rate?</strong> The comparison rate puts together interest rates, fees, and other possible charges into a single percentage. This makes it easier for the borrower to compare options.</li>
 	<li><strong>What fees are possibly added on top of the loan?</strong> Fees are application fees, processing fees, termination fees, and exit fees. Other fees include monthly ongoing fees such as advance fees and service fees.</li>
 	<li><strong>Secured or unsecured?</strong> Decide on a secured or an unsecured loan. Both choices have their pros and cons but the right choice will depend on your business's needs and situation. An unsecured loan will mean higher interest rates while secured loan will mean higher loan amounts equivalent to your assets but remember that your assets are at stake in case you make a default.</li>
