Geoff shook his head glumly. “That’s the third bank that knocked us back. Each time I speak with anyone, they are all really enthusiastic right up until I mention that we want to owner build. When I do, it’s like I just grew another head – they can’t get off the phone quick enough.”

Susa rubbed his back “Maybe it is time we thought about just bringing a builder in and building the house that way?” “But I’ve always dreamed of building the home for my family to live in,” Geoff said. “It was one of the reasons I apprenticed as a carpenter.” “Maybe it is time to try a specialist broker?

Owner builder projects are much less common in Australia than standard construction home loans. It is not an area that banks traditionally like to operate in and it pays to have someone on your side who knows which financial institutions are currently offering owner builder finance and knows range of packages on offer. Specialists in owner builder finance also understand the importance of research and will often use tools such as RP Data and Real Estate.com to give the project the best possible chance to go ahead.

The types of questions a specialist will ask are: what exactly will the property be like once it is completed? Are there many properties like that in the area? Does the research indicate that the area is about to become a local hotspot?
