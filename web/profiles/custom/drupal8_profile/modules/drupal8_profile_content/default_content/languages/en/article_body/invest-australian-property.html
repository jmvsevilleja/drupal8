<strong>Why choose Australian property?</strong>

More and more overseas investors are looking towards Australian property because they want returns and security not offered in their own country.

The Australian property market is attractive for many reasons:

<strong>A stable property market</strong>

The property market in Australia has a proven track record of stability. Overseas markets like Hong Kong or the USA have suffered major collapses in property values. Housing values in unstable economies can fall up to 70% in a matter of weeks, and investors are left with significant losses.

The Australian market has never seen median house prices drop over 20% in one year. During the Global Financial Crisis of 2009 / 2010, when property prices in the UK and USA plummeted - Australian houses rose in value.

<strong>Solid growth</strong>

Over the last 100 years, Australian properties have displayed reliable capital growth. Australian property prices have almost doubled every 7 to 10 years.

Property prices have been increasing steadily as populations in Australia’s major cities continue to grow rapidly. Housing shortages in many major cities continue to push property values up.

<strong>Quality of living</strong>

Australia is world famous for its unique multicultural cities and natural wonders.

Each of Australia’s states and territories of Australia have something to offer. Queensland has a coast that is renowned for beaches and reefs, Victoria for its coast line and the cultural city of Melbourne, South Australia (SA) for its wine regions, the Northern Territory (NT) for its iconic outback and New South Wales (NSW) for the Blue Mountains and Sydney.

Australian is not only attractive because of the growth and stability of its residential real estate market. Many large foreign investors take advantage of the lucrative <a href="https://www.realcommercial.com.au/news/tag/brisbane">commercial property market</a>.

<strong>Research and finance</strong>

You also have to consider your own financial situation before investing significant time into the application process. Make sure you have your personal debt and finances under control. You will not be able to get a loan if the Bank suspects you are not financially able to afford the mortgage.
