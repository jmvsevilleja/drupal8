Construction loans or building loans are ideal if you are building a new home or planning a major renovation to your existing home. So whether you are based in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth or anywhere else in Australia, we will source the appropriate construction finance or owner builder finance to assist you in realising your dream home.

A construction loan is very specific to those who want to build a new home and sign a building contract with a licenced builder. The lender will determine the total amount you will need in order to pay your builder and then break it down into separate payments, called progress draws. This progress draws are the amounts paid to your builder throughout the construction stages. While these draws are being made, most lenders will only expect you to pay the interest due on them. Your full principal and interest payments won’t start until after the handover and when you receive the keys to your new home.

<strong>Construction home loan and a standard home loan</strong>

The difference between a construction home loan and a <a href="/personal-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standard home loan</a>is that instead of a lump sum payment at agreement sign-off, the loan is usually drawn down in stages for a construction loan. Payments, drawdowns, coincide with the initial purchase of the land, followed by a number of key construction stages. When the construction loan is fully drawn down and the property is complete, it usually reverts to a standard home loan as agreed with the mortgage lender.

<strong>Construction loans are ideal for building</strong>

Construction loans are ideal for building, as you only pay interest on the amount you draw down. For instance, if you have borrowed $300,000 for a house and land package, but you have only drawn down $150,000 to pay for the land, you only pay interest on the $150,000 and not the full amount.

<strong>Payment control</strong>

The mortgage lender will use a valuer to assess the land and proposed construction. The mortgage lender also monitors the construction process and only makes progress payments when the builder has reached certain objectives and met satisfactory standards. You will need to provide invoices to the mortgage lender who controls payments to the builder.
