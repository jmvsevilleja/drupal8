Enjoy the security of a <a href="/1-year-fixed-home-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fixed interest rate home loan</a>, where the rate will not change during the fixed rate period and your repayments will remain the same. Home loans offer a range of fixed interest rate home loan options and the ability to split your loan: part fixed, part variable. However fixed rates are generally higher than variable rates and you’ll find it harder to switch home loans, as some providers charge an exit fee if you try to refinance during the fixed rate period. You’ll also lose out on some flexible features including a 100% offset account, but the good thing is these days many fixed rate loans come with an extra repayments facility.

Do you want to transfer your interest rate to a variable from fixed? It’s a great time to secure a low rate on a fixed rate home loan because interest rates are at a notable low.

You can have many benefits from fixing your lower interest rate. A fixed rate gives you repayment stability and simplifies your loan.
