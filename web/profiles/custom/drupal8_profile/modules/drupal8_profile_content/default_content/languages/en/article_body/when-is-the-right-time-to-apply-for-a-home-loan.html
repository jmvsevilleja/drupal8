Everybody dreams of having their own home. However, being able to afford one is a challenge for many, even for the above average Aussie employee. Getting a home loan is the most common avenue that people resort to, to be able to afford to buy a home.

There are many types of home loans available for Australians of all economic status. Even people with bad credit can avail a home loan, through non-conforming lenders that entertain bad credit home loan applications.

With so many options available for home financing, is there a right time to avail a home loan? Will a planned or perfectly timed application increase the chances of getting approved or in securing better rates and loan terms?
<h2>Timing is Everything When <a href="https://www.intellichoice.com.au/home-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Applying for Mortgage</a></h2>
There exists a mortgage business cycle that is common for almost all lending services. The first weeks of the months is usually spent in finding a client, documents from these clients are then processed up until the early half of the month. The last weeks of the month are dedicated in closing as many possible deals or loan applications since most lending services are aiming to reach a certain quota for their monthly performances. So, which is the right time to file for a mortgage application, with this schedule as your guide?

Considering the enthusiasm that loan brokers have during the start of the month, it would be ideal to file for an application during the first few days of the month. Loan applications are reviewed faster, and your phone calls are even returned promptly during the first few weeks of the month.

But how will you know if it is the right time for YOU to apply for a mortgage?
