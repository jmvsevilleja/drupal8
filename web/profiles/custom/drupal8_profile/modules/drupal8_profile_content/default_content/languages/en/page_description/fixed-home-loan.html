<h2>Fixed Home Loan</h2>
Fixed Home Loans allow you to lock in a particular interest rate on your principal for a pre-agreed period of time. Doing such allows you to allocate a certain amount for the duration of your fixed loan term. It is advisable to get a fixed rate loan when the interest rate in the market is low and about to grow in the coming years.
