In really simple terms <a href="https://www.intellichoice.com.au/trade-finance">Trade Finance</a> is when an exporter requires an importer to pay for goods that are shipped to them.

As part of the transaction the person who is responsible for importing the goods may require documentation of exactly what goods have been shipped.

The importer’s bank may provide what is known as a letter of credit to the bank of the exporter which essentially states that they will pay for the goods. The exporters bank may then advance the funds to the exporter based on the strength of the export contract.

Trade finance simply fills the gap that is often left between payments for imports and actual receipt of funds through the sale of the stock.

It can provide important cash flow at a time when it is most required. The right trade finance package can make an enormous difference to the success or failure of your business
