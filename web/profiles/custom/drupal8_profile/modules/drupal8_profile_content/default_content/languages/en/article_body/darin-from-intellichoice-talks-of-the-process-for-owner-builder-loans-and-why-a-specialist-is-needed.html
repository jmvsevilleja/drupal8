<h2>Darin from Intellichoice talks of the process for Owner-Builder Loans-and why a specialist is needed</h2>
This video will provide insight into why specialist knowledge is needed for setting up and using <a href="https://www.intellichoice.com.au/owner-builder-home-loans">Owner-Builder Loans</a>. When choosing people to help with these types of projects it is absolutely critical that the broker or lender has an in-depth understanding of all the nuances of these loan types. Many things can change during the Owner builder construction process and if the people advising don’t have completion experience with these loan types, there’s a risk the project will stall mid-way through. This is an unmitigated disaster as there are normally no lenders willing to help clients with half-finished owner-built home. When contemplating becoming an Owner-builder be sure to surround yourself with experienced people who can advise during the course of your build.

It is something where you might be engaged with that person for anywhere from six months or two years while they’re doing their, so you wanna have a good rapport with somebody and you really want them to be an industry expert otherwise when things go wrong invariably they do the outside forces in most cases.
