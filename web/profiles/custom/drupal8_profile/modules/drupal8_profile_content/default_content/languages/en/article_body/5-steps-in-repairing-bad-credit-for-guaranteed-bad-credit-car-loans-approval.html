<h1>5 Steps in Improving Your Credit Score Fast</h1>
<h2>Keep your card balances low</h2>
The very basic tip you can follow in improving your credit score fast is by paying your credit card balances. The less debt you have, the better your credit standing will be. If possible, pay your credit card balances in full or twice or thrice the minimum required payment every month. A high outstanding debt can greatly affect your credit score.

Bad credit histories and bad credit rating are mostly associated with credit card balances. Securing a car even though a car loan with bad credit can be quite difficult with too much credit card balances on your plate.
<h2>Pay bills on time</h2>
Although it is a must to pay a bill on time, some people still fail to do so. Whether its lack of finances or simply forgetfulness, not paying your bills on time reflects on your credit file.

<h2>Keep good debt accounts on your credit report</h2>

Multiple attempts to apply for a credit or to take out a financing, say a car finance or a mortgage, and failing in the process will also appear on your file and will affect your credit score negatively.
