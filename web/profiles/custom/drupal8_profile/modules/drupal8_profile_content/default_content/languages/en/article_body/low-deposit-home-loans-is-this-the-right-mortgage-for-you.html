<h3>What are Low Deposit Home Loans?</h3>
Low deposit home loans, also referred to as high Loan to Value Ratio (or High LVR) loans. Such home loans are designed for individuals trying to avail of a home loan but not able to meet the standard 20% deposit. This type of loan can allow 5 to 15% deposit. However, expect the interest on the loan to become higher compared to the total value of the home.

While loan companies can offer to fund about 95% of the home value, that price is normally regarded as high risk. Consequently, potential borrowers are thoroughly checked out on their fiscal position and capacity to make monthly payments while living a comfortable lifestyle.

July 2018 revealed a record drop of 44% in terms of banks and lenders offering 95% home loans. Tighter restrictions for high LVR loans from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is one of the significant reasons for this, thus making it <a href="https://www.theadviser.com.au/breaking-news/37896-lenders-slashing-high-lvr-home-loans-ratecity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harder to secure a low deposit home loans</a>. However, with the right mortgage experts, you can still secure a 95% home loan. Intellichoice Finance connects you to this few, but reliable lenders that still offer low-deposit mortgages.

<h3>Benefits of Low Deposit Home Loans</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Up to 5% of the property value minimum. While standard home loans may require you a down payment of about 20%, low deposit loans can go as low as 5% minimum deposit. Imagine if you can make a $25,000 deposit vs $500,000 deposit. This scenario is a huge relief to many borrowers while it's a quick route to owning a property of your own.</li>
 	<li>Using a guarantor. By using your parents’ or any family members' or friends' property (should be with the consent of the guarantor) as a security to take out a loan, you can get a better chance of approval and be gaining the lender's attention. This is because you have a guarantee to offer and lenders are assured that they are able to get their money's worth.</li>
 	<li>Using a guarantor could additionally help you avoid extra payments for Lenders’ Mortgage Insurance that may soon add up to a large sum of money. Note though that when you get a guarantor, there should be a common understanding of the consequences in case the borrower defaults on payments.</li>
 	<li>Also, by using a guarantor with good credit, you may also have access to better terms such as regular interest rates and features like regular home loans.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drawbacks of Low Deposit Home Loans</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Considered a high-risk borrower. Loan companies consider loans with low deposit as high risk. Therefore, they demand sufficient proof that you are financially capable to make repayments. This loan may also demand higher interest rates and may result in higher monthly repayments.</li>
 	<li>Typically, loan companies will request borrowers to provide a savings account statement that covers 3-6 months of deposits. This requirement is called genuine savings. Loan companies would like to see regular deposits that the borrower has managed to save at least 5% of the total property value.</li>
 	<li>Lenders' Mortgage Insurance (LMI) and other fees. One of the drawbacks of low deposit home loans is the additional costs on Lenders’ Mortgage Insurance (LMI). This insurance is to safeguard the loan company from any kind of problems if the borrower defaults on repayments or not pay at all. Note that LMI is non-transferable so that if you decide to switch lenders the previous LMI cannot be used by the other. There are also other fees that you need to pay such as application fee, settlement fee, service fee, and some other charges.</li>
