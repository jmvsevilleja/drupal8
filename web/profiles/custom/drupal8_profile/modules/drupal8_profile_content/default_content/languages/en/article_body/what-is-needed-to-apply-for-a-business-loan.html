Applying for a business loan can help both starting and growing businesses. It can help you acquire a new equipment for the business, increase supply or to improve your business cash flow. However, there are requirements on applying for a business loan. Banks and lenders also set standards as to how much a business owner can loan, depending on the assets that the business has as well as the capacity of the business to repay a loan.

2. Details of the asset that you will use to secure your business loan. Generally, you can get as much as 80% of the residential asset that you will use to secure your loan. Sixty-five percent for commercial properties and 70% for rural properties.

3. Your business score should be more than 600 to be able to qualify for a business loan. This can be a personal credit score, or if you are already in business, your business credit score can be submitted.

4. Proof of individual incomes, bank statements, identifications and a few other details about the finances of your business. Your annual revenues are also important factors that determine how much business loan you can afford to pay. A business is required to have $50,000-$150,000 in revenues to be able to qualify for a loan.

5. Start-up businesses that do not have more than a year of historical data can submit a detailed business plan with accurate profit and loss predictions as documentation for your application.

6. Buying an existing business will require you to submit 2 years of historical data of that business, a business plan, and a profit and loss statement.
